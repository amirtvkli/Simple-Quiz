# User-Experience Quiz
I created a simple multiple choice quiz as a web page basic techniques and technologies used in HTML5.
The Quiz questions are written by [Raluca Budiu](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/author/raluca-budiu/) on January 7, 2018, at [NN Group](https://www.nngroup.com).
You can test your UX knowledge by taking this quiz. It includes 10 questions. (At the end you can see the articles that all questions and answers are based on.)

I recommend using _`Firefox`_ for running this project. because of using JSON which Chrome and some other browsers will not display if offline.
